          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          The backdrop of this analysis focuses on the potential of movies to
          serve as a self-healing tool, particularly for individuals with mental
          health challenges. With mental health issues becoming increasingly
          prevalent, understanding the intersection between personality traits,
          movie preferences, and audience engagement offers a unique opportunity
          to explore personalized and therapeutic avenues.

                  A significant proportion (50.20%) of individuals with mental
                  health challenges do not report their conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Among those who do not report, over 64% exhibit medium to high

                  The reluctance to disclose mental health issues, particularly
                  among those with severe conditions, highlights a gap in
                  accessing timely intervention. This suggests that alternate
                  forms of engagement, such as recreational activities like
                  movie-watching, could play a supportive role in mental
                  well-being.

                  Frequent movie-watching, as observed in the more balanced
                  personality trait distribution, may serve as a universal

            <li>
              <b>Niche Opportunities:</b> Niche genres, though less common, hold
