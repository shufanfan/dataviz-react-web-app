            </h2>
            <p>
              Similar to listening to music, watching movies is a common mental
              activity in people‚Äôs daily lives, providing varying degrees of
              psychological comfort to different individuals through different
              types of films. Music therapy has been applied as a clinical
              psychotherapy method, whereas film therapy has yet to be explored.{" "}

            <p>
              This project aims to investigate the potential of movies to serve
              as a self-healing tool, particularly for individuals with mental
              health challenges. With mental health issues becoming increasingly
              prevalent, understanding the intersection between personality
              traits, movie preferences, and audience engagement offers a unique
              opportunity to explore personalized and therapeutic avenues.

                  <i>The Big Five Personality Test</i>
                </b>{" "}
                is a psychological assessment tool that measures an individual‚Äôs
                personality across five broad dimensions: Openness,
                Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
                Each dimension represents a spectrum, with individuals scoring
                somewhere along the continuum for each trait.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this project, we only focus on the following three
                personality dimensions:

                  </b>{" "}
                  indicates a tendency for self-discipline, carefulness, and
                  dependability.
                </li>

                  measures sociability, enthusiasm, and assertiveness in social
                  situations.

                    <i>Neuroticism</i>

                  captures emotional stability and the tendency to experience
                  negative emotions such as anxiety and moodiness.
