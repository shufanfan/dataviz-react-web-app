                The hesitance to open up about mental health struggles,
                especially for those grappling with severe challenges, reveals a
                crucial gap in accessing timely help. This highlights the
                potential of alternative pathways for connection and
                reliefâ€”recreational activities like movie-watching could offer
                not just comfort but also a meaningful boost to mental
                well-being.
